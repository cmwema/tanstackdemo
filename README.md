# tanstackdemo

This project is a simple one-page React website that displays a list of cars with details such as make, model, and model year. The data for the cars was generated using [Mockaroo](https://www.mockaroo.com/).

## Technologies Used

- **React**: The project is built using the React library for building user interfaces.
- **TanStack**: TanStack, which stands for TypeScript, Apollo, Next.js, and Prisma, is a modern full-stack JavaScript/TypeScript stack for building web applications.
- **Luxon**: Luxon is a library for working with dates and times in JavaScript. It was used to style the SQL dates from the data.
- **Material-UI (Mui)**: Material-UI is a popular React UI framework for designing and developing web applications with a consistent and customizable design system.

## Features

The website includes the following features:

- Pagination: Allows users to navigate through multiple pages of car listings.
- Sorting: Enables users to sort the car listings based on different criteria such as make, model, and model year.
- Filtering: Provides options for users to filter the car listings based on specific criteria.

## Note

The UI design of the website is basic and not visually appealing. It serves as a demonstration of the functionality rather than a polished user interface. Further improvements can be made to enhance the design and user experience.
